   <h1>To my Babu,</h1>

<p>
I don’t even know where to begin, because there are so many things I’ve carried in my heart
for so long and never found the right moment to say. Maybe this is that moment.
Maybe this is my way of sitting beside you, even when I can’t actually be there.
</p>

<p>
I am so incredibly proud of the person you are becoming my grown-up boy.
Sometimes I still see the little child you once were, running around without a care,
and sometimes I see the young man you’re slowly turning into, stronger and more thoughtful
than you probably realise. Watching you grow from afar hasn’t been easy, and I wish more
than anything that I could have been there for every single step.
</p>

<p>
There are days when I miss you so much it feels physical.
I miss the stupid arguments we used to have over the smallest things,
the laughter that would follow, and the comfort of knowing you were just there.
I miss how you could understand me without me saying anything,
how your presence alone could make things feel lighter.
</p>

<p>
Being away from you has taught me how precious those ordinary moments were.
The days that felt simple back then are the ones I hold onto the most now.
Every memory, every laugh, every fight they all live with me,
no matter how far apart we are.
</p>

<p>
I want you to know something very clearly:
you mean the world to me.
You always have, and you always will.
You are not just my brother you are my safe place,
my strength, and a part of me that distance can never take away.
</p>

<p>
I know growing up isn’t easy.
There will be moments when you feel lost, moments when you doubt yourself,
and moments when you feel like the world is asking too much from you.
When those moments come, I want you to remember this 
you are stronger than you think, kinder than you realise,
and capable of so much more than you give yourself credit for.
</p>

<p>
I’m sorry I couldn’t be there to see you grow every day.
I’m sorry I missed things I wish I had been part of.
But I promise you this:
I will always be here for you in every way I can be.
I promise to support you, to stand by you,
and to give you everything you deserve.
</p>

<p>
You deserve the world, my little baby,
and even if I can’t hand it to you all at once,
I will spend my life trying to bring it to you piece by piece.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being you.
Thank you for being understanding, patient, and loving in ways you may not even notice.
Thank you for being my brother.
</p>

<p>
No matter where life takes us,
no matter how many miles stand between us,
you will always have me 
cheering for you, believing in you,
and loving you more than words can ever fully explain.
</p>

<p>
Always.
</p>
